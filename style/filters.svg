        Contains filters for common color-blindness conditions, which are applied to plots in the Jupyter output
        via CSS filter attributes. Inspired by https://github.com/interaktivarum/rgblind.

        Transformations are from https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~oliveira/pubs_files/CVD_Simulation/CVD_Simulation.html and
        a description of the filter format is at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/feColorMatrix

        For now this only has the most severe cases of color blindness. The reference above contains matrices for less
        severe cases. In future, add them all, and have a setting to adjust color-blindness severity.
